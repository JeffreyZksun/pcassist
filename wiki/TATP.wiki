=Introduction=

Task Automation Transformation Protocol (TATP) is a text-based protocol, in which a sender communicates with a receiver by issuing command strings and supplying necessary data over a reliable ordered data stream channel, typically a Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) connection.

The basic character set consists 94 characters: 3 control characters: space (<SPACE>), carriage return (<CR>), line feed (<LF>) and the 91 graphic characters below.

For illustration purposes here (not part of protocol), the protocol exchanges are prefixed for the server (S:) and the client (C:).

Every line ends with <CR><LF>. They are omitted for the sake of brevity.

==Client send script data to server==
Client sends the connection request, and server accepts it. Then
{{{
C: HELLO my client id
S: 250 WELCOME v2.54
C: SCRIPT
S: 250 SCRIPT End data with <CR><LF>.<CR><LF>
C: <action>
C:    <parameter> ... </parameter>
C:    <parameter> ... </parameter>
C: </action>
C: .
C:
S: 250 ok: queued as 12345
C: QUIT
S: 221 Bye
}}}
==Invalid command==
Client sends the connection request, and server accepts it. Then
{{{
C: GUESS who am I?
S: 337 Invalid command line
C: QUIT
S: 221 Bye
