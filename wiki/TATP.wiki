=Introduction=

Task Automation Transformation Protocol (TATP) is a text-based protocol, in which a sender communicates with a receiver by issuing command strings and supplying necessary data over a reliable ordered data stream channel, typically a Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) connection.

An TATP session consists of commands originated by an client (the initiating agent, sender, or transmitter) and corresponding responses from the TATP server (the listening agent, or receiver) so that the session is opened, and session datas are exchanged.

During the communication session, only the basic character set is used. The basic character set consists 94 characters: 3 control characters: space ({{{<SPACE>}}}), carriage return ({{{<CR>}}}), line feed ({{{<LF>}}}) and the 91 graphic characters below.
{{{
abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
0123456789
_{ }[]#()<>%:;.?*+-/ˆ&| ̃!=,\"’
}}}
=Command format=
Normally each line ends with {{{<CR><LF>}}}is a complete command string. 

==Request data from client to server==
{{{
command-name<SPACE>string-data<CR><LF>
}}}
==Response data from server to client==
{{{
result-code-number<SPACE>string-data<CR><LF>
}}}

==non-command line==
Normally every line is a command, except the session enters the data transformation context. Such as the SCRIPT command.


=TATP transport example=
For illustration purposes here (not part of protocol), the protocol exchanges are prefixed for the server (S:) and the client (C:).

Every line ends with {{{<CR><LF>}}}. They are omitted for the sake of brevity.

==Client send script data to server==
Client sends the connection request, and server accepts it. Then
{{{
C: HELLO my client id
S: 250 WELCOME v2.54
C: SCRIPT
S: 250 SCRIPT End data with <CR><LF>.<CR><LF>
C: <action>
C:    <parameter> ... </parameter>
C:    <parameter> ... </parameter>
C: </action>
C: .
C:
S: 250 ok: queued as 12345
C: QUIT
S: 221 Bye
}}}
==Invalid command==
Client sends the connection request, and server accepts it. Then
{{{
C: GUESS who am I?
S: 337 Invalid command line
C: QUIT
S: 221 Bye
}}}
