The BehaviorBodyFactory is singleton. All the applications share the same factory instance.
The exction context is the bridge between behavior node and behavior body. The behavior node populate the context. All the required information by the body can be got from the context.

The paramter related classes constitute a independent pamerater sub-system. Such as parameter, parameter table and variable manager. It doesn't depends on the BrainAPplication or Behavior factory.
